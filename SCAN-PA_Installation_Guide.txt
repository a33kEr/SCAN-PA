SCAN-PA: The Multi-Tool Web Vulnerability Scanner Installation Guide

This document provides a detailed guide for installing and setting up SCAN-PA on your local machine.

1. Prerequisites
================
Before installing SCAN-PA, ensure that the following requirements are met:

- **Python 3.6+** must be installed on your system.
- Basic Linux command-line knowledge is required.
- Internet access is required for performing certain external scans.
- Certain external tools should be installed to take advantage of SCAN-PAâ€™s full functionality. These tools include:
    - Nmap
    - SSLyze
    - theHarvester
    - Wafw00f
    - Nikto
    - Uniscan
    - Golismero
    
To install these tools, use the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get install nmap wafw00f nikto uniscan golismero
pip3 install sslyze
pip3 install theHarvester
```

2. Cloning the Repository
=========================
1. Open your terminal.
2. Clone the SCAN-PA repository from GitHub by running the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/a33kEr/SCAN-PA.git
```

3. Navigate to the directory of the cloned repository:

```
cd SCAN-PA
```

3. Installing Dependencies
==========================
SCAN-PA may require certain Python packages. The dependencies can be installed as follows:

- Ensure you have pip installed. If not, run:

```
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

- Install the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file (if available). Otherwise, ensure that the `setuptools` library is installed:

```
pip3 install setuptools
```

4. Running SCAN-PA
===================
To run the SCAN-PA tool, use the following command:

```
python3 SCAN-PA.py
```

You can also run it with arguments to configure the scan. For example:

- **Scanning a domain**:

```
python3 SCAN-PA.py example.com
```

- **Skipping certain tools (e.g., dmitry and theHarvester)**:

```
python3 SCAN-PA.py example.com --skip dmitry --skip theHarvester
```

5. Updating SCAN-PA
====================
To update SCAN-PA to the latest version, run:

```
python3 SCAN-PA.py --update
```

6. Additional Tools
===================
If you would like to install additional tools or dependencies, refer to their specific documentation or use the following commands to install them via `apt` or `pip`.

7. Troubleshooting
==================
- **Python Version Issues**: Ensure you are using Python 3.6 or above by checking with `python3 --version`.
- **Permission Denied Errors**: If you encounter permission errors, try running the commands with `sudo`.
- **Missing Tools**: Ensure all required tools (Nmap, SSLyze, etc.) are properly installed by running them directly in the terminal.

For any further issues, please consult the project's GitHub page or open an issue.

8. Conclusion
=============
Once installed, SCAN-PA will be ready to use for web vulnerability scanning. Feel free to customize the usage by enabling or skipping specific tests and updating the tool as needed.
